Best case: O(n) - This occurs when the list is already sorted, and the algorithm only needs to iterate through the list once.
Average case: O(n^2) - This happens when elements are randomly distributed in the list, leading to multiple comparisons and swaps.
Worst case: O(n^2) - This occurs when the list is sorted in reverse order, resulting in the maximum number of comparisons and swaps at each step.
