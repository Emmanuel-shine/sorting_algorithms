Best case: O(n log n) - In the best case, Quick sort will divide the array into nearly equal partitions, resulting in a balanced recursion tree and efficient sorting.
Average case: O(n log n) - In the average case, Quick sort exhibits optimal performance, partitioning the array into balanced subarrays and sorting them efficiently.
Worst case: O(n^2) - In the worst case, Quick sort may perform poorly if the pivot selection results in highly unbalanced partitions, leading to a degenerate recursion tree and inefficient sorting.
