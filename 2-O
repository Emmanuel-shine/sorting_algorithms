Best case: O(n^2) - In the best case, Selection sort will perform nested loops through the array, resulting in quadratic time complexity.
Average case: O(n^2) - In the average case, Selection sort will perform nested loops through the array, resulting in quadratic time complexity.
Worst case: O(n^2) - In the worst case, Selection sort will perform nested loops through the array, resulting in quadratic time complexity.
